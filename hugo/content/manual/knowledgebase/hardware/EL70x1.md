### error/warning
If the El70x1 is in error or warning state, further information about the reason for the error/warning can be read from the drives diagnostic register by using the ethercat command. See [command line interface](ethercatcli).

{{% notice info %}}
In order to use the ethercat command, you must first login to the server where the ecmc IOC is running.

The diagnostic data can be read from register [Index A010 STM Diag data Ch.1](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/english.php?content=../content/1033/el70x1/2286662027.html&id=126846504617985959) with the following syntax:

The ecmccfg/utils/read_el70xx_diag.sh tool can be used to read all the diagnostic registers:
```bash
bash read_el70xx_diag.sh <master_id> <slave_id>
```

Example: master 0, slave 3, drive under voltage warning
```bash
bash read_el70xx_diag.sh 0 3

Note: The tool ecmccfg/utils/PDO_read can also be used for reading the diagnostics.

#### under voltage

Use a multimeter to verify that the voltage level corresponds to voltage levels described in the electrical drawings. If the voltage is correct, then the under voltage alarm could be related to wrong setting of nominal drive voltage setting (48V but the drive is powered with 24V).

The nominal drive voltage setting can be changed by the U_NOM_MV macro when applying the component (ecmccomp).

Example: Set nominal voltage to 24V
```
${SCRIPTEXEC} ${ecmccfg_DIR}addSlave.cmd,       "HW_DESC=EL7041-0052"
${SCRIPTEXEC} ${ecmccomp_DIR}applyComponent.cmd "COMP=Motor-Generic-2Phase-Stepper,  MACROS='I_MAX_MA=1000, I_STDBY_MA=500, U_NOM_MV=24000, R_COIL_MOHM=1230'"
```

For the EL703x drives the nominal voltage must be set to 24V (ecmccomp handles this automatically).

#### over voltage

Use a multimeter to verify that the voltage level corresponds to voltage levels described in the electrical drawings. If the voltage is correct, then the over voltage alarm could be related to wrong setting of nominal drive voltage setting (24V but the drive is powered with 48V).

The nominal drive voltage setting can be changed by the U_NOM_MV macro when applying the component (ecmccomp).

Example: Set nominal voltage to 48V
```
${SCRIPTEXEC} ${ecmccfg_DIR}addSlave.cmd,       "HW_DESC=EL7041-0052"
${SCRIPTEXEC} ${ecmccomp_DIR}applyComponent.cmd "COMP=Motor-Generic-2Phase-Stepper,  MACROS='I_MAX_MA=1000, I_STDBY_MA=500, U_NOM_MV=48000, R_COIL_MOHM=1230'"
```

### Tuning

There are normally several control loops in an ecmc system:
* Position loop (centralized in ecmc if CSV)
* Velocity loop (in drive)
* Current loop (in drive)

However, for the EL70x1 drives there's no dedicated velocity loop (however some current boost settings that can be applied in acc/dec, see below)

For more information on tuning the position loop see [tuning](../../tuning)

#### Current loop
For most use cases, the default current controller parameters are already well tuned. Sometimes when operating at higher speeds the current loop needs to be tuned. 

The following parameters can be tuned for a EL70x1 stepper drive:
* 8011:07 Ka factor 
* 8011:08 Kd factor
* 8011:01 Kp factor
* 8011:02 Ki factor

#### 8011:07 Ka and 8011:08 Kd factor:

8011:07 Ka factor / 8011:08 Kd factor are “current boosts” during acceleration/deceleration.
Default they are set to 100% which is normally is too high for most applications. Start by setting these parameters to 0.

#### 8011:01 Kp  and 8011:02 Ki factor:
This is the current loop settings and this is also what affect the performance. The higher you set these registers, the stiffer the control loop.
For most applications it is important to keep a ration of 40:1.
Default is 400 / 10, if you want a stiffer loop, then change to f ex 800 / 20 and onwards.
Increase until the motor misbehaves and go back to a safe setting.
