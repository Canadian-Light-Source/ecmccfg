# Stream
 WARNING: Using stream (asynOctet interface) can/will result in major latancy increase of the ecmc_rt thread. This could lead to missed EtherCAT frames.
 
 A better approach is to use PLC code instead since most things can be done using plcs.

## Examples
The db and protocol directory include some obsolete examples (just kept for reference).
