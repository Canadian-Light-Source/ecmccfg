# Test dir for el6022

## For sending recieving bytes

Use ecmcEL6022_bytes.substitution

## For sending recieving zero terminated string

Use ecmcEL6022_string.substitution

This is used in the example script. 

Note: the only difference is that in the sting case the outbytes are reduced by 1 (to remove the zero termination).
