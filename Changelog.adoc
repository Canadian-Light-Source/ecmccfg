== v8_RC1

=== config
yaml based configs are now linted and schema validated.
The configuration capabilities have been extended to end effector, aka virtual axes, sync PLCs, ...

These features need to be tested for the v8 release!

==== breaking
- typo fixed: `tollerance` -> `tolerance`
- structure has changed slightly

=== dependencies

- `ECMC` version `ruckig` (aka `v8`): Due to a fixed typo in the `ECMC` command set, which required a fix in the `jinja2` templates.
